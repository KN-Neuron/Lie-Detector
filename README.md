# Lie Detector EEG Experiment: Comprehensive Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation and analysis pipeline of an EEG-based lie detection experiment. Inspired by [Neural processes underlying faking and concealing a personal identity: An EEG study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/368455020_Neural_processes_underlying_faking_and_concealing_a_personal_identity_An_electroencephalogram_study), this project aims to classify truthful versus deceptive responses to identity-related prompts using neural network models, traditional machine learning algorithms, and carefully designed preprocessing and feature extraction techniques.

Developed by the _Lie-Detector Team_, the experiment and analyses included here serve as a comprehensive exploration—from raw EEG data collection, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis, through feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Description

This project revolves around detecting deception in identity statements using EEG signals. Participants were instructed to respond “yes” or “no” to identity-related information in multiple experimental blocks, sometimes honestly and sometimes deceptively. By analyzing the resulting EEG signals, the objective was to uncover neural markers of truth-telling and deception.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Inspired Research**: Built upon previous EEG studies exploring neural correlates of deception and identity masking.
- **Robust Experimentation**: Controlled EEG experiment with well-defined blocks of trials for truthful and deceptive responses to real or fake personal identities.
- **Comprehensive Data Pipeline**: From EEG headset recordings to final classification models, including preprocessing, ICA, feature extraction, and hyperparameter optimization.
- **Multi-Model Approach**: Includes Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, and advanced neural network architectures (DGCNN, FBCNet, LSTM).

## Data and Experiment Setup

Participants responded to identity-related prompts (their own, fake, celebrity, and random identities) under instructions to either tell the truth or lie. The **`experiment`** directory contains code for:

- **Personal Data Generation**: Real, fake, celebrity, and random identity details managed by a personal data module.
- **GUI**: A Pygame-based interface presenting stimuli and recording participant responses.
- **EEG Headset Integration**: Data acquisition scripts utilizing MNE and BrainAccess libraries, with annotated trials.

## Preprocessing, Feature Extraction & ICA

Before model training, EEG signals were preprocessed to remove noise and artifacts. Techniques included band-pass filtering, notch filters, and ICA for artifact removal. Additional feature sets were engineered (mean, std, variance, skewness, kurtosis, frequency band powers) to boost classification performance.

## Machine Learning & Neural Networks

Multiple classifiers were tested:

- **Traditional ML**: Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression.
- **Neural Networks**: DGCNN, FBCNet, and LSTM architectures trained on EEG timeseries and extracted features.

Grid searches and hyperparameter tuning refined model performance. Subject-based and random splits were compared, highlighting the challenges in generalizing across individuals.

## EDA & Results Visualization

Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provided insights into response times, event-related potentials (ERPs), and participant consistency. While EDA findings did not directly influence model training, they offered a deeper understanding of the dataset.
